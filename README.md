Creepair
========

A Spigot plugin that rebuilds natural environments after they're exploded by creepers. Blocks are rebuilt over the ~10 seconds or so after the explosion, allowing players to vacate the area safely.

Useful for large survival servers where creepers are likely to exist around the world spawn.

The configuration file allows limiting based on height and types of blocks (materials and tags).

Compatible with WorldGuard to avoid block duplication.
